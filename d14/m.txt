1️⃣ Single-Slot 3-Stage Pipeline

You are given N tasks.
Each task must go through exactly 3 stages in strict order:

Stage-1 → Stage-2 → Stage-3

Constraints

Exactly 3 threads (one per stage)

No buffer / queue / list

Only ONE shared handoff object

A task must complete Stage-1 before Stage-2 starts

A task must complete Stage-2 before Stage-3 starts

Tasks must be processed one at a time

Sample Input
3
TaskA
TaskB
TaskC

Sample Output
STAGE1 processed TaskA
STAGE2 processed TaskA
STAGE3 processed TaskA
STAGE1 processed TaskB
STAGE2 processed TaskB
STAGE3 processed TaskB
STAGE1 processed TaskC
STAGE2 processed TaskC
STAGE3 processed TaskC

2️⃣ Ordered Thread Printing (Dynamic Threads)

You are given N threads and a number M.

Each thread has an ID from 1 to N.

Goal

Print numbers from 1 to M in strict round-robin order of threads.

Sample Input
N = 3
M = 9

Sample Output
Thread-1 prints 1
Thread-2 prints 2
Thread-3 prints 3
Thread-1 prints 4
Thread-2 prints 5
Thread-3 prints 6
Thread-1 prints 7
Thread-2 prints 8
Thread-3 prints 9

3️⃣ Read → Process → Write Document System

A shared Document must be handled in strict order:

READ → PROCESS → WRITE

Constraints

One Reader thread

One Processor thread

One Writer thread

No thread can skip a step

No buffering allowed

Multiple documents must be handled sequentially

Sample Input
2
Doc1
Doc2

Sample Output
READ Doc1
PROCESS Doc1
WRITE Doc1
READ Doc2
PROCESS Doc2
WRITE Doc2

4️⃣ Traffic Intersection Controller

Four directions:

NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST

Rules

Only one direction green at a time

Cars must cross in arrival order

No starvation

Emergency vehicles get priority

Sample Input
5
NORTH car1
EAST car2
NORTH car3
WEST ambulance
SOUTH car4

Sample Output
NORTH car1 crossed
EAST car2 crossed
WEST ambulance crossed
NORTH car3 crossed
SOUTH car4 crossed

5️⃣ Bank Transfer System (Deadlock-Safe)

Multiple accounts and transfers.

Rules

Transfers must be atomic

No deadlocks

No inconsistent balances

Sample Input
Accounts:
A 1000
B 2000

Transfers:
A B 300
B A 500

Sample Output
Transfer A -> B : 300 SUCCESS
Transfer B -> A : 500 SUCCESS
Final Balance:
A = 1200
B = 1800

6️⃣ Thread-Safe LRU Cache

Design a cache with capacity C.

Rules

Least recently used item is evicted

Multiple threads may access cache

Sample Input
Capacity = 2
PUT 1 10
PUT 2 20
GET 1
PUT 3 30

Sample Output
GET 1 -> 10
Evicted Key: 2

7️⃣ Custom Thread Pool

Implement a thread pool from scratch.

Sample Input
PoolSize = 2
Tasks = 5

Sample Output
Worker-1 executing Task-1
Worker-2 executing Task-2
Worker-1 executing Task-3
Worker-2 executing Task-4
Worker-1 executing Task-5

8️⃣ Rate Limiter (Token Bucket)

Allow X requests per second.

Sample Input
Rate = 3/sec
Requests = 6

Sample Output
Request-1 ALLOWED
Request-2 ALLOWED
Request-3 ALLOWED
Request-4 REJECTED
Request-5 REJECTED
Request-6 REJECTED

9️⃣ Barrier Synchronization File Processor

Multiple threads process a file in 2 phases.

Sample Input
Threads = 3

Sample Output
Thread-1 Phase-1 done
Thread-2 Phase-1 done
Thread-3 Phase-1 done
--- Barrier ---
Thread-1 Phase-2 done
Thread-2 Phase-2 done
Thread-3 Phase-2 done
